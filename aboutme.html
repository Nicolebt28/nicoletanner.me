  <p class="aboutme__title">Hello! My name is Nicole, I'm glad you're here!</p><br>
  <p class="aboutme__column1">I am an aspiring web developer that has always loved learning about "the process."  The process of creating a thrown pot, a well crafted latte, a flowing story (consequentially I have been an ameteur artist, barista, and English major).  Unsuprisingly I developed a passion for learning about one of the most ever present objects in our contemporary lives, the web- and what appears on it.</p><br>
  <p class="aboutme__column2">Everything is brought together by elements that play off of each other and are ordered in a way to create one specific outcome.  Learning how to program has been a new form of creation that I am very excited to further pursue and master.  I hope you enjoy my portfolio here as it is and see that future with me! Feel free to explore!</p>
